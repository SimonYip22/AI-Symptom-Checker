A simple **Python-based rule-based AI symptom checker**, a command-line tool that ranks possible medical conditions based on user-entered symptoms. Designed for educational purposes and future AI/ML expansion.

---

## TL;DR

Enter symptoms one by one, and the program returns the **top 3 likely conditions** ranked with % likelihood, and with matched symptoms, returns **most likely condition** and advice for management.

---

## Features

- Covers 6 common primary-care conditions:
  - Urinary Tract Infection, Influenza, Gastroenteritis, Otitis Media, Migraine, Pneumonia  
- Input normalisation & alias mapping, so handles **lay-term symptom input** (e.g., "high temperature" â†’ "fever")  
- Rule-based inference with formula-weighted scoring to rank conditions by likelihood  
- Top 3 conditions as well as most likely condition, displayed with advice  
- Modular design for easy extension  
- Structured clinical reasoning in a command-line interface (CLI)

---


## Quick Start

Clone repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonYip22/ai-symptom-checker.git
cd ai-symptom-checker
python ai_symptom_checker.py 
```

- Press Enter to start
- Enter symptoms one at a time
- Type "done" when finished
- Type "exit" to quit

## Example session

```text
Enter a symptom: diarrhoea
Enter a symptom: vomiting
Enter a symptom: stomach pain
Enter a symptom: done
You have entered these symptoms:  ['diarrhoea', 'vomiting', 'abdominal pain']

Top 3 possible conditions:
Gastroenteritis (stomach bug): 32.3% | Matched symptoms: ['diarrhoea', 'vomiting', 'abdominal pain']
Influenza (flu): 9.1% | Matched symptoms: ['vomiting']
Migraine: 7.3% | Matched symptoms: ['vomiting']

Likely diagnosis is:  Gastroenteritis (stomach bug)
Advice: Stay at home and get plenty of rest, drink plenty of water to stay hydrated (small sips if you feel sick),
 Try and eat when you feel able to, paracetamol +/- ibuprofen if in pain.
Important: This tool is for educational purposes only and does not replace medical advice. If you are worried about your symptoms, please contact NHS 111.
 Call 999 or go to A&E immediately if your symptoms are severe, sudden, or life-threatening.
Press Enter to start symptom checker, or type 'exit' to quit:

## Running Tests

Test the scoring logic and alias handling:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Reflections

- Learned input normalization, lay-term mapping, weighted scoring, and modular function design
- Balanced clinical accuracy with usability
- Future improvements (more advanced AI techniques for MSc final project):
  - Machine learning classifiers for automated condition ranking
  - NLP for symptom entity recognition
  - Bayesian inference & probabilistic reasoning
  - Front-end UI & integration with external datasets/APIs
