# ðŸ§ª Sample Runs â€” Clinically-Informed AI Symptom Checker  
This document logs **test runs** across development stages (Day 1 â†’ Day 3), demonstrating how the tool handles user input, normalisation, scoring, and final presentation of results. Each example reflects **clinically-informed mappings** that make outputs interpretable and relevant.

# Day 1: Input Cleaning and Symptom Mapping

##input
user_input = input("What symptom do you have? ")
normalised = normalise_choice_input(user_input)
print("You typed:", user_input)
print("Canonical symptom detected:", normalised)

## Test 1 â€“ Basic symptom input
User input: "Painful pee"
Normalized: "painful urination"
Notes: Successfully mapped lay term to canonical symptom.

## Test 2 â€“ Mixed case & spaces
User input: "   Fever  "
Normalized: "fever"
Notes: Leading/trailing spaces removed, case normalized.

## Test 3 â€“ Punctuation removal
User input: "Can't hold pee!"
Normalized: "urinary urgency"
Notes: Apostrophe and exclamation mark removed, lay term mapped correctly.

## Test 4 â€“ Alias with hyphen
User input: "night-time pee"
Normalized: "night time urination"
Notes: Hyphen replaced with space, mapped to canonical symptom.

## Test 5 â€“ Unrecognized input
User input: "sore arm"
Normalized: "sore arm"
Notes: Input not in aliases; returned as-is. Consider handling unknown symptoms later.

## Reflections
- normalize_choice_input() works as intended for common lay terms.
- Cleaning removes punctuation, hyphens, and extra spaces.
- Lay-term mapping ensures users can type in everyday language.
- Need to consider how to handle unrecognized symptoms in the future.

##Reflection:
Implemented the weighted scoring system to rank conditions based on user symptoms. 
Learned how to combine user input validation, symptom alias handling, and dictionary-based scoring. 
Practiced iterating through nested data structures and formatting output for clarity. 
Reinforced the importance of modular functions and testing with multiple symptom scenarios.
