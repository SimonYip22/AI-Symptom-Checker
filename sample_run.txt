# Sample Run – Day 1: Input Cleaning and Symptom Mapping

##input
user_input = input("What symptom do you have? ")
normalised = normalise_choice_input(user_input)
print("You typed:", user_input)
print("Canonical symptom detected:", normalised)

## Test 1 – Basic symptom input
User input: "Painful pee"
Normalized: "painful urination"
Notes: Successfully mapped lay term to canonical symptom.

## Test 2 – Mixed case & spaces
User input: "   Fever  "
Normalized: "fever"
Notes: Leading/trailing spaces removed, case normalized.

## Test 3 – Punctuation removal
User input: "Can't hold pee!"
Normalized: "urinary urgency"
Notes: Apostrophe and exclamation mark removed, lay term mapped correctly.

## Test 4 – Alias with hyphen
User input: "night-time pee"
Normalized: "night time urination"
Notes: Hyphen replaced with space, mapped to canonical symptom.

## Test 5 – Unrecognized input
User input: "sore arm"
Normalized: "sore arm"
Notes: Input not in aliases; returned as-is. Consider handling unknown symptoms later.

## Reflections
- normalize_choice_input() works as intended for common lay terms.
- Cleaning removes punctuation, hyphens, and extra spaces.
- Lay-term mapping ensures users can type in everyday language.
- Need to consider how to handle unrecognized symptoms in the future.



# Day 2: Scoring System

## Example Run 1
Enter symptoms one by one. Type 'done' when finished.

Enter a symptom: fever
Enter a symptom: done
You have entered these symptoms:  ['fever']

Condition scores:
Urinary Tract Infection (urine infection): 0.043
Influenza (flu): 0.136
Gastroenteritis (stomach bug): 0.040
Otitis Media (inner ear infection): 0.091
Migraine: 0.000
Pneumonia (chest infection): 0.039

## Example Run 2
Enter a new set of symptoms to score again.

Enter symptoms one by one. Type 'done' when finished.

Enter a symptom: fever

##Reflection:
Implemented the weighted scoring system to rank conditions based on user symptoms. 
Learned how to combine user input validation, symptom alias handling, and dictionary-based scoring. 
Practiced iterating through nested data structures and formatting output for clarity. 
Reinforced the importance of modular functions and testing with multiple symptom scenarios.
