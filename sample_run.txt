# Sample Run – Day 1: Input Cleaning and Symptom Mapping

##input
user_input = input("What symptom do you have? ")
normalised = normalise_choice_input(user_input)
print("You typed:", user_input)
print("Canonical symptom detected:", normalised)

## Test 1 – Basic symptom input
User input: "Painful pee"
Normalized: "painful urination"
Notes: Successfully mapped lay term to canonical symptom.

## Test 2 – Mixed case & spaces
User input: "   Fever  "
Normalized: "fever"
Notes: Leading/trailing spaces removed, case normalized.

## Test 3 – Punctuation removal
User input: "Can't hold pee!"
Normalized: "urinary urgency"
Notes: Apostrophe and exclamation mark removed, lay term mapped correctly.

## Test 4 – Alias with hyphen
User input: "night-time pee"
Normalized: "night time urination"
Notes: Hyphen replaced with space, mapped to canonical symptom.

## Test 5 – Unrecognized input
User input: "sore arm"
Normalized: "sore arm"
Notes: Input not in aliases; returned as-is. Consider handling unknown symptoms later.

## Reflections
- normalize_choice_input() works as intended for common lay terms.
- Cleaning removes punctuation, hyphens, and extra spaces.
- Lay-term mapping ensures users can type in everyday language.
- Need to consider how to handle unrecognized symptoms in the future.
